#PS. Not all of these variables can be used for every message.
#I have put in the maximum amount of variables possible.

#Variables:
#%p = player that is being discussed.
#%p2 = an additional player that is being discussed.
#%r = reason for punishment
#%t = time for world time or punishment time.
#%a = amount/name, can be for balance, name of homes, names of items, modes for flying/creative, etc.
#%a1 = amount/name 2, pretty much just used for item amount.
#%u = usage for a command.
#%t = time for teleporting.
